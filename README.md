# World of FluxCraft - Reality
This is the reality (game state) service for the World of FluxCraft sample. It is responsible solely for allowing for the update (PUT) and query (GET) of completed/cached game state. The event processor is responsible for computing the game state. This service is a cache that is used by the UI to load the state of existing games when the Flux application initializes.
